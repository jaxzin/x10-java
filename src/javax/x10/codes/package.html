    Contains classes that represent X10 codes.  You are unable to
instantiate any of these classes directly and can only use the constants defined
within {@link javax.x10.codes.HouseCode}, {@link javax.x10.codes.UnitCode}, and
{@link javax.x10.codes.FunctionCode}.
</P>
<P>
    The X10 protocol addresses units(like lights, drapes, etc.) with a scheme
consisting of a {@link javax.x10.codes.HouseCode}, represented by the letters 
<B>A</B> through <B>P</B>, and a {@link javax.x10.codes.UnitCode}, represented
by the numbers <B>1</B> through <B>16</B>.
Since each has 16 possible values, there are 256 possible addresses for X10
controlled appliances in your home. Addresses can be shared if you would like to
control, two lights for instance, at the same time, allowing for more that 256 
controlled appliances.  The X10 protocol also allows several addresses to be
addressed at the same time, though this is limited to addresses with the same
{@link javax.x10.codes.HouseCode}, i.e. <B>A1</B> and <B>A5</B> can be addressed
at the same time because they both have the {@link javax.x10.codes.HouseCode} of
<B>A</B>, but <B>A1</B> and <B>B2</B> can not.
</P>
<P>
    There are 16 different commands that can be carried out by X10 appliances.  These
commands are represented by {@link javax.x10.codes.FunctionCode}s.  Examples of
addressing appliances and sending them functions to carry out would be:
<LI>Address <B><CODE>A1</CODE></B>, Address <B><CODE>A2</CODE></B>, Function <B><CODE>DIM</CODE></B> by 25%;
This dims the lights with addresses <B><CODE>A1</CODE></B> and <B><CODE>A2</CODE></B> by 25% of their current value.</LI>
<LI>Address <B><CODE>B4</CODE></B>, Function <B><CODE>OFF</CODE></B>, Address <B><CODE>C3</CODE></B>, Function <B><CODE>ON</CODE></B>; 
This turns appliance <B><CODE>B4</CODE></B> off and then <B><CODE>C3</CODE></B> on.</LI>
<LI>Function <B><CODE>ALL_LIGHTS_OFF</CODE></B>; Turns all lights off in all house codes, but not appliances that are not light.  For those, use <B><CODE>ALL_UNITS_OFF</CODE></B></LI>
</P>
<P>
    All of these codes are delivered within {@link javax.x10.event.X10Event} 
using an {@link javax.x10.X10Transmitter}.
