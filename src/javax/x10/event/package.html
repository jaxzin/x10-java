Provides interfaces and classes for dealing with different types of events 
fired by X10 components.  {@link javax.x10.X10Receiver}s are the major
producer of {@link javax.x10.event.X10Event}s, and {@link javax.x10.X10Transmitter}s
are the only producer of {@link javax.x10.event.X10TransmitterEvent}s.
{@link javax.x10.X10Transmitter}s can also accept user created 
{@link javax.x10.event.X10Event}s and deliver them through some implementation-specific
media.
